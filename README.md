# uno-card-place-check
### November Habitica Programming Challenge

Uno card game. Write a program that checks if the player can place a card.

Challenge Description
Write a function that takes in two arguments: a player's current hand and the current face-up card on the table.
The function will return true if the player can place a card on top, or false if the player has to draw from the deck.

A player can place a card if either:

They have a card that is the same colour as the face-up card.
They have a card that is the same number as the face-up card.
Return false if the player is not holding any cards.
In our deck there are no special cards or wild cards.
